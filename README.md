# SimpleMusicList
This project implements a simple audio player using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
It allows users to play different audio tracks by clicking on associated play icons.
When a user clicks a play icon, the corresponding audio track starts playing from the beginning, while any other tracks that are currently playing are paused.
The functionality is achieved by using the querySelectorAll method to select play icons and audio elements, and event listeners to handle user interactions.
